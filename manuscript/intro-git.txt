# Introduction to git & GitHub

Developing websites and applications without using git is equivalent to writing in Microsoft Word without ever saving your work.

**Use git.**

Git is a version control system, which means it can track every change you make to your code. This allows you to review and edit past versions if you mess something up. And it allows you to figure out when errors were introduced to the code.

There are many other bonuses to using git, which are mostly out of this book's scope.

The best way to start learning git (and GitHub) is to visit [try.github.com](http://try.github.com). You should also try [githug, a game for learning git](https://github.com/Gazler/githug).

## Here are some basics of using git:

Create a git repository:

~~~~~~~~
cd name-of-folder
git init
~~~~~~~~

Add files:

~~~~~~~~
git add name-of-file

// or add all files in directory:

git add .
~~~~~~~~

When you add files to a git repository they are "staged" and ready to be committed.

Remove files:
~~~~~~~~
git rm name-of-file

// force removal of files:

git rm -rf name-of-file-or-directory
~~~~~~~~

Commit files and add a message using the `-m` option:

~~~~~~~~
git commit -m 'a message describing the commit'
~~~~~~~~

Create a branch:

~~~~~~~~
git branch name-of-branch
~~~~~~~~

Checkout a branch:

~~~~~~~~
git checkout name-of-branch
~~~~~~~~

Shortcut for creating a new branch and checking it out:

~~~~~~~~
git checkout -b name-of-branch
~~~~~~~~

Merge a branch into the master branch:

~~~~~~~~
git checkout master
git merge name-of-branch
~~~~~~~~

Add a remote repository:

~~~~~~~~
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourname/projectname.git
~~~~~~~~

List associated repositories:

~~~~~~~~
git remote -v
~~~~~~~~

Pull changes from a remote repository:

~~~~~~~~
git pull origin master
~~~~~~~~

Push changes to a remote repository

~~~~~~~~
git push origin master
~~~~~~~~

Checkout a remote branch:

~~~~~~~~
git checkout -t origin/haml
~~~~~~~~

## Get on GitHub
If you haven't already, create an account at [github.com](http://github.com).

GitHub is a great place to host your code. Many employers hiring for developer and designer positions will ask for a GitHub profile, and they'll use your GitHub activity as part of the criteria in their decision-making process.

In fact, if you're looking to get a job with a particular company, try to find _their_ GitHub profile and start contributing to their open source projects. This will help you stand out, and they'll already know your technical abilities based on your open source contributions. That's a big win.

GitHub has become the de facto code hosting service for most open source communities.

### With GitHub Pages you can:
- design a website any way you want by having complete control over the html, css, and javascript.
- use simple templates for getting started using GitHub Pages.
- create sites for yourself and all of your projects hosted on GitHub.
- use a custom domain name if you want!

Visit the [help section for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles) to learn more details about hosting sites on GitHub.


## Create a site for yourself using GitHub

GitHub has a useful service called [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) that allows you to host a simple site on their servers for free.

To get started, fork this simple template: [github.com/maxogden/gh-pages-template](https://github.com/maxogden/gh-pages-template).

Visit that github project, make sure you're logged in, and click Fork in the upper right side of the screen.

Fork gh-pages-template to your personal account.

Rename the repository from gh-pages-template to whatever you want by clicking on Settings on the right side of your fork of the repository, and changing the name there. GitHub will warn

That's it! You now have a website hosted through GitHub Pages.

You'll be able to visit your site at __YOUR-USERNAME__.github.com/__YOUR-PROJECT-NAME__.

You'll want to edit the content though, right? Add your cat pictures or resume or pizza recipes? You can do that.

You can create, edit, move, rename, and delete files all through the GitHub website. Check out these blog posts on GitHub for details on how to do those things:
- [Create files](https://github.com/blog/1327-creating-files-on-github)
- [Edit files](https://github.com/blog/143-inline-file-editing)
- [Move and rename files](https://github.com/blog/1436-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github)
- [Delete files](https://github.com/blog/1545-deleting-files-on-github)

You can also clone the project repository onto your computer:

~~~~~~~~
git clone git@github.com:__YOUR-USERNAME__/__YOUR-PROJECT-NAME__.git
~~~~~~~~

You can copy the git url to clone from the right-hand sidebar of your project repository.

After cloning the repository, `cd` into it and make some changes:

~~~~~~~~
cd __YOUR-PROJECT-NAME__
nano index.html
~~~~~~~~

Add a bunch of content to index.html, and change the styles in style.css.

After you've made some changes, add them to the repo and commit the changes:

~~~~~~~~
git add .
git commit -m 'include a brief, clear message about the changes'
~~~~~~~~

Now, push your changes back to GitHub:

~~~~~~~~
git push origin gh-pages
~~~~~~~~
