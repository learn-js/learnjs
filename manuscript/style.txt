## Javascript style guide & syntax cheatsheet


### Variables

#### Creating a variable:

~~~~~~~~
var nameOfVariable;
~~~~~~~~

> Variables are camelCase, meaning first letter is lowercase, and if the variable is made of multiple words, the first letter of following words are capitalized.

#### Creating a variable that references a string:

~~~~~~~~
var thisIsAString = 'this is a string';
~~~~~~~~

Surround strings with single quotes.


#### Creating a variable that references a number:

~~~~~~~~
var thisIsANumber = 3.14;
~~~~~~~~

Numbers do not have quotes around them.

#### Creating a variable that references an array:

~~~~~~~~
var thisIsAnArray = [1, "two", [3, 4]];
~~~~~~~~

Note that one of the values in the array is a number, one is a string, and another is an array. Arrays can hold any value in any order.

#### Accessing the values in an array:

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnArray[0];
~~~~~~~~

The above will return the number `1`. Arrays use numbers as the index of their values, and with javascript an array's index always start at `0`, making `0` reference the first value of the array.

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnArray[1];
~~~~~~~~

This returns the string 'two';

##### How would you return the number `4` from the nested array?

Like this:

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnArray[2][1];
~~~~~~~~

#### Creating a variable that references an object:

var thisIsAnObject = {
  someString: 'some string value',
  someNumber: 1234,
  someFunction: function(){
    return 'a function that belongs to an object';
  }
}

Here we're setting `someString` to `'some string value'`, `someNumber' to `1234`, and we're creating a function named `someFunction` that returns the string `'a function that belongs to an object'`. So how do we access these values?

To get the value of `someString` using dot notation:

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnObject.someString;
~~~~~~~~

Or using bracket notation:

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnObject['someString'];
~~~~~~~~

To get the value of `someNumber` using dot notation:

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnObject.someNumber;
~~~~~~~~

Or using bracket notation:

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnObject['someNumber'];
~~~~~~~~

To use the function `someFunction` using dot notation:

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnObject.someFunction();
~~~~~~~~

Or using bracket notation:

~~~~~~~~
thisIsAnObject['someFunction']();
~~~~~~~~

Using square bracket notations with functions looks a little wacky. It will be useful if you are storing function names in variables as strings, and need to use the variable to call the function being stored. Otherwise, stick with dot notation.
That goes for other attributes on an object, too: stick with dot notation unless there's a good reason to use bracket notation.

For instance, it's more clear to use bracket notation in a situation like this:

~~~~~~~~
for (var key in object){
  thisIsAnObject[key];
}
~~~~~~~~

This gives you an idea of how to iterate through an object using a for...in loop.
